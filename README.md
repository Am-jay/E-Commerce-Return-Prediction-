This repository showcases a comprehensive machine learning assessment grouped into two distinct parts:

Part I: E-commerce Product Return Prediction 
This project focused on binary classification to predict the likelihood of product returns in an E-commerce setting using a given dataset.

Models Compared: Logistics Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Methodology: The work included robust feature scaling, cross-validated hyperparameter tuning, and a comprehensive performance comparison using relevant classification metrics.

Part II: Business Traveler Market Segmentation 
This project focused on unsupervised learning for market segmentation.

Algorithms: Employed K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.

Techniques: Integrated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

Outcome: Analyzed the resulting clusters to derive actionable business strategies for distinct traveler segments
